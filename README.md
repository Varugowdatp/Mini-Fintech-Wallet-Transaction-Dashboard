# Mini Wallet Hub

A React-based wallet management application that demonstrates transaction lifecycle handling, balance management, filtering, error handling, and testing using a mock API.

---

## Features

### Wallet
- View current wallet balance
- Add money to wallet
- Transfer money to other users
- Automatic 2% transaction fee on transfers

### Transactions
- Supports transaction states:
  - `pending`
  - `success`
  - `failed`
- Balance updates only when a transaction is successful
- Failed transactions do not affect balance
- View recent transactions
- View complete transaction history
- Delete completed transactions

### Filters
- Filter transactions by status (all / pending / success / failed)
- Filter transactions by date range

---

##  UX & Error Handling

- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Inline form validation
- Loading skeletons during data fetch
- Global error handling using a React Error Boundary

---

##  Tech Stack

- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- Browser LocalStorage (mock backend)
- Vitest + React Testing Library

---

##  API Design (Mock)

The application follows REST-style behavior using a simulated API.

| Action | Method |
|------|--------|
| Fetch balance | GET |
| Fetch transactions | GET |
| Create transaction | POST |
| Update transaction status | PATCH |
| Delete transaction | DELETE |

Transactions are created in a **pending** state and later updated to **success** or **failed**, simulating real-world payment processing.

---
##  Architectural Notes

The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns.

- **UI Components**  
  All reusable UI elements such as Header, BalanceCard, TransactionCard, Modals, and Filters are placed inside the `components` directory.  
  These components are stateless where possible and receive data via props.

- **Page-Level State Management**  
  The main application state (balance, transactions, filters, loading states) is managed in `Index.jsx`.  
  This keeps business logic centralized and avoids unnecessary prop drilling.

- **Service Layer (API Abstraction)**  
  All data-related operations are abstracted into `services/api.js`.  
  This simulates REST-style API behavior (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) and allows easy replacement with a real backend in the future.

- **Transaction Lifecycle Design**  
  Transactions are created in a `pending` state and later updated to `success` or `failed`.  
  Balance updates are triggered only when a transaction succeeds, ensuring correct financial logic.

- **Global Error Handling**  
  A React Error Boundary wraps the application to catch unexpected runtime errors and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the app.

- **Testing Architecture**  
  Tests are organized into component tests, service-level tests, and integration tests to ensure correctness at multiple levels.

This architecture improves maintainability, testability, and scalability while keeping the application simple and aligned with assignment scope.

## Mock API Data

This project uses a mock API layer implemented in `src/services/api.js`.

Initial mock data (wallet balance and transactions) is seeded programmatically
into localStorage on the first application run. The API layer simulates
asynchronous CRUD operations, network delays, pending states, and failure
scenarios without using a real backend.

To reset mock data, clear browser localStorage and reload the application.


##  Testing

Tests are implemented using **Vitest** and **@testing-library/react**.

### Coverage
- Unit tests for UI components
- Service-level API tests
- Integration test for wallet flow
- Error Boundary fallback test

### Run tests
```bash
npm test
````

##  Assumptions

* The assignment allows a mock backend; therefore LocalStorage is used instead of a real server.
* Network latency and asynchronous behavior are simulated using artificial delays.
* Transaction fee is fixed at 2% for demonstration purposes.
* Balance is updated only when a transaction succeeds.
* Failed transactions are stored for audit/history but do not affect balance.
* Each browser maintains independent LocalStorage.
* User authentication and authorization are out of scope.
* Currency is assumed to be a single configurable currency defined in application configuration.

---
##  Limitations

- Uses LocalStorage, so data is browser-specific and non-persistent.
- No real payment gateway or backend server integration.
- No authentication or authorization mechanism.
- Concurrent transactions are not handled.
- Application state resets when browser storage is cleared.


##  Setup & Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
